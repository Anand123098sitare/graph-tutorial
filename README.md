# 📘 Graph Representations & Conversions in Python

This notebook helps you understand and convert between three core graph representations:

- **Adjacency Matrix**
- **Adjacency List**
- **Edge List**

---

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- Compute degree of each node in any format
- Convert between matrix, list, and edge representations
- Understand graph structures through clear Python examples

## 🧠 Graph Basics

A **graph** is a set of nodes connected by edges. Graphs can be:
- **Undirected** (edges go both ways)
- **Directed** (edges have a direction)

Common uses: social networks, maps, web pages, and more.
